1. SUB ARRAY -> Contigious
            -> The key observation fact for the count of the subarray is the number of ends position possible for
            each index elements of the array can be (N â€“ i), Therefore the count of the subarray for an array of
            size N can be:
            Count of Sub-arrays = (N) * (N + 1)
                                 ---------------
                                        2
2. SUB SEQUENCE -> Differnt combination
               -> The key observation fact for the count of the subsequence possible is each element of the array
                  can be included in a subsequence or not. Therefore, the choice for each element is 2.
                  Count of subsequences = 2 to the power N

3. What is PRIME NUMBER
1.   We first check if the number is less than 2 (since 1 is not considered a prime number), and return false in that case.
     If the number is equal to 2, we return true, since 2 is the only even prime number.
2.   Next, we use the bitwise AND operator (&) to check if the least significant bit of the number is 0.
     If it is, then the number is even and therefore not prime.
3.   If the number passes these two checks, we then use a for loop to check if the number is divisible by any
     odd number between 3 and the square root of the number (inclusive). If it is, then the number is not prime
     and we return false.
